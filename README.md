# LeNet_pytorch
LeNet CNN architecture using PyTorch 

## Environment

It is assumed that the user has installed PyTorch and its required dependencies (i.e. python etc)

## Training and Testing:

The LeNet architecture was trained and tested on the MINST dataset to ensure the functionality was correct. From [2] the same architecture was used to build a smile detection network.
